## 1. What this project is, precisely

It is **a replacement GL library**, not a mod that patches GL calls.

FCL and similar launchers load a GL implementation by path and hand it to
LWJGL. Normally that path points at a translation layer (GL4ES, ANGLE, Zink)
which converts desktop GL calls into GLES calls. This project provides a
library at that path instead, so:

- **Forwarded symbols** reach the device's real GLES driver directly, with one
  trampoline and no per-call translation.
- **Custom implementations** handle the places where desktop GL and GLES
  genuinely differ (enum values, texture formats, shader source, missing
  functions).
- **Shader compatibility** is handled by rewriting GLSL source on the way into
  the driver.

The consequence of the last point is the single most important thing to
understand about this codebase:

> Desktop GLSL performs implicit `int` → `float` conversion. GLSL ES does not.
> A shader that compiles on desktop can therefore fail on ES. Most of
> `native/src/shader.c` exists to close that gap.

```

Two deliberate asymmetries:

**Java never calls into native; native never calls into Java.**
The native library is loaded by the launcher (`dlopen`), which is a different
class-loading context from the mod's JVM. Calling back would require attaching
threads across two loaders and is fragile for no benefit. Instead native writes
two files and Java polls them.

**Java is not on the render path.**
It reports capability, logs degradation, and detects optimisation mods. No
per-frame work happens in Java.

---

## 3. The two delivery forms

One native core, two thin wrappers, three build artifacts:

| Artifact | Contents | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `glesmod-1.0.0.jar` (~30 KB) | Java only | Capability reporting, compat detection, config, diagnostics |
| `glesmod-renderer-plugin.apk` (~2.3 MB) | Manifest + `lib/*/libgl_gles.so` | **The actual renderer.** FCL loads the `.so` from here |
| `libgl_gles.so` (per ABI) | native core | Also available standalone for other launchers |

> **The native library is not in the jar.** Installing only the jar changes
> nothing observable. This trips people up constantly, so it is stated in the
> README too.

### 3.1 Why an APK is the plugin format

FCL discovers renderer plugins by scanning installed packages for
`meta-data` entries (FCL `PluginManager.kt` / `RendererPlugin.kt`). An Android
package is simply the delivery mechanism for those metadata entries and the
`.so` files. There is no code that runs inside the APK at render time; the
plugin's Activity never launches.

The manifest is **v1 format**, and several fields are required only because
FCL's parser returns early (silently) if any is missing:

| Field | Why it exists |
|---|---|
| `fclPlugin=true` | Marks the package as a plugin during discovery |
| `renderer=GLES Mod:libgl_gles.so:libEGL.so` | `name:GL:EGL`. We supply GL; **EGL is reused** |
| `des=…` | Display name. Must be a literal, not `@string/…` — `PackageManager` stores a resource ID for resource references, and FCL calls `Bundle.getString()`, which then yields null |
| `boatEnv=…` | **Required but unused.** FCL's `parseV1()` does `getString("boatEnv") ?: return`, so a missing key silently disables the whole plugin |
| `pojavEnv=…` | Environment variables, `KEY=VALUE:…` |
| `minMCVer` / `maxMCVer` | Stop FCL offering this renderer on incompatible versions |
| `extractNativeLibs="true"` | FCL builds the `.so` path from `ApplicationInfo.nativeLibraryDir`; without extraction the file is not there |

Two environment variables are non-negotiable, both learned from crashes:

- **`POJAV_RENDERER=opengles3`** — FCL's `egl_bridge.c` does
  `strncmp("opengles", getenv("POJAV_RENDERER"), 8)` with no null check. FCL sets
  this itself only for v2 plugins; for a v1 plugin it is absent, `getenv`
  returns NULL, and the process SIGSEGVs during `glfwInit()`. Verified on device.
- **`LIBGL_ES=3`** — decides the EGL context version. FCL sets it automatically
  only for built-in renderers, so a plugin must set it or get an ES 2 context.

---

## 4. Native layer

### 4.1 Symbol inventory — 849 exported symbols

| Kind | Count | Source | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| `F` forwarded | 339 | `generated_forwarders.c` (generated) | Resolve the real GLES symbol once, cache it, tail-call it |
| `C` custom | 26 | `custom.c` | Hand-written, because behaviour must differ |
| `S` safe stub | 484 | `generated_forwarders.c` (generated) | No-op that returns a neutral value and records a degradation event |

`native/symbols.def` is the **single source of truth** for which symbol is in
which class. `native/tools/gen_symbols_def.py` and `gen_gl_forwarders.py`
generate the code from it; they are not edited by hand.

**Why 484 stubs is a feature, not a gap.** The alternative is a missing symbol,
which LWJGL cannot resolve, which aborts startup. A stub lets the game run and
tells you exactly which feature is silently inert:

```
glGetIntegerv(GL_NUM_EXTENSIONS)  ->  real count + 1
```

The one extra extension is `GL_ARB_draw_buffers_blend`, reported because some
code paths test for it before using multi-target blending.

### 4.2 Custom implementations (26)

These exist where a pure forward is wrong. Two examples that show the pattern:

**`glGetString(GL_VERSION)`** returns
`"3.2 (OpenGL ES 3.2 <renderer>)"`. Minecraft and many mods parse this string
and branch on desktop GL semantics, so it must look like a desktop GL version
while remaining truthful about the underlying ES version.

**`glShaderSource`** is where the entire converter is wired in. It also
**always records every shader's source** so that a later compile failure can be
diagnosed — see §10.

### 4.3 The `RESOLVE_OR_RETURN` pattern

Every guarded entry point looks like this:

```c
static fn_t real = NULL;                       /* cached after first call */
glesmod_lazy_init();
RESOLVE_OR_RETURN(real, "glBindTexture", );
real(a, b);
```

Properties that matter:

- Resolution happens **once**, not per call.
- A missing symbol reports a degradation event and returns a neutral value
  instead of crashing.
- The steady state is a single load-and-branch, measured at 19.4 instructions
  on arm64 (`native/tools/hotpath_cost.py`), down from 29 before optimisation.

### 4.4 Degradation model

Nothing in this project is allowed to crash the game. When something is
unavailable:

1. A **reason code** is recorded (`native/include/gles_backend.h`,
   `glesmod_degrade_code`), counting repeats rather than logging each one.
2. A **substitute** is used where one exists; otherwise the call becomes inert.
3. The state is written to `status.json`, where the Java layer picks it up.

Reason codes are a **frozen contract**: values may be deprecated but never
reused, because third parties may branch on them. The native enum and the Java
enum `DegradeReason` must be kept in sync; the Java side maps an unknown code to
`UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION` and logs a warning rather than throwing.

---

## 5. The GLSL → GLSL ES converter

This is the riskiest component and where most of the engineering effort went.
It lives entirely in `native/src/shader.c` (~10 000 lines).

### 5.1 The problem

Desktop GLSL and GLSL ES differ in ways that change *whether a program
compiles*, not merely how it performs:

| Desktop GLSL | GLSL ES |
|---|---|
| Implicit `int` → `float` | **Illegal.** `float x = 1;` is an error |
| `vec2 v = ivec2Var;` | **Illegal.** No implicit integer→float vector conversion |
| `vec2 v = ivec2(1,2);` | Illegal |
| `texture2D(s, uv)` | `texture(s, uv)` |
| `gl_FragColor` | `out vec4` declared by the shader |
| `#version 330 core` | `#version 320 es` |
| sampler types have default precision | **Every sampler type needs `precision`** |

So the converter must do real type analysis, while being a linear scanner — it
has no full parser and no symbol table beyond what it builds itself.

### 5.2 Pipeline order

`glesmod_convert_shader_source()` runs these stages in this order:

1. **Early out** if the source already declares `#version … es`.
2. `expand_moj_imports` — expand `#moj_import <file>`. (On device this is
   already done by Minecraft before the source reaches us; retained as
   defence.)
3. `extract_version`, then `strip_desktop_extensions` — remove extensions that
   exist only on desktop.
4. `expand_int_const_macros` — inline integer constant macros first, so that a
   macro used in both integer and float contexts is judged per use site.
5. **Qualifier conversion** and sampling-function renaming.
6. `normalize_int_literals` — the core. Rewrites integer literals to float
   where the context is genuinely floating-point. Internally a set of rules
   (A–M, plus later additions) evaluated in a fixed precedence order.
7. `fix_int_vector_float_ops` — handles mixed integer/float vector arithmetic
   (situations A–I).
8. `fix_mixed_int_uint` — `int`/`uint` mixing.
9. `fix_return_int_in_float_fn` — `return` of an integer expression from a
   function declared `float`.
10. `rewrite_nonconst_globals` + `inject_global_assignments` — GLSL ES requires
    initialisers to be constant expressions; non-constant global initialisers
    are hoisted into an injected assignment function.
11. **Assembly** — prepend `#version 320 es`, precision declarations, sampler
    precision, and map `gl_FragColor`.

### 5.3 The central difficulty: context is not local

The naive rule "if the statement contains `vec4`, float-ise its integers" is
wrong, and every rule added later is a correction to a specific class of
false positive. Representative examples, all found on real devices:

| Construct | Why the naive rule breaks | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| `textureSize(tex, 0)` | `lod` **must be `int`**. But if this appears as `vec2(textureSize(tex,0))`, the enclosing float constructor makes the literal look float | `INT_ARG_BUILTINS` records per-function integer argument positions; the literal is preserved |
| `textureLod(tex, uv, 0)` | Here `lod` **must be `float`**, so `.0` is required | Deliberately absent from that table — same syntax, opposite requirement |
| `int i = 0;` inside a statement that also mentions `vec3` | Declaration site is integer, use site is float-looking | Declaration-site guard; also names appearing in both integer and float tables are dropped from the float table (§5.4) |
| `f(1)` for a user function `void f(int)` | We know built-in signatures, not user ones | A user function signature table is collected from definitions-with-a-body; a literal is only converted when the parameter type is known |
| `i.pose` where `i` is a struct | `i` was collected as an integer variable from an unrelated `int i` in another scope | A scalar cannot have a member; `.` after a table hit means the hit is wrong, so the rewrite is abandoned |
| `cross(i, …)` where `i` came from `vec3 i = q.xyz` | `cross` takes floats so the wrapper was applied without float evidence; `i` looked integer because another function had `int i` | Local declaration class lookup walks to the enclosing function body and uses the nearest declaration |

The general shape of the fix in each case is the same: **find a piece of
evidence that is locally decidable, and refuse to rewrite without it.**

### 5.4 Implementation conventions you must follow

- **Control switches.** Every risky rule has a `-DGLESMOD_NO_RULE_X` compile
  switch. They exist so a change can be *attributed* via an A/B build rather
  than assumed. Adding a rule without a switch makes regressions untraceable.
- **Required-string markers.** Every rule emits a unique marker string on first
  use (e.g. `GLESMOD_RULE_S_BUILTIN_INT_ARGS`), registered in
  `native/tools/required_strings.txt`. A build gate asserts every marker is
  present in the built `.so`. Without this, a stale binary silently looks
  "fixed" — a mistake that cost a full device test round.
- **Forward declarations.** Helpers defined late in the file but used in
  `process_stmt` must be declared near the top. gcc then degrades to an implicit
  `int` declaration and the build fails; the dangerous failure mode is a script
  that only checks whether the executable exists and therefore runs the old
  binary.
- **Match parentheses correctly.** When scanning backwards for the enclosing
  call, `)` must increment the depth counter and `(` must only decrement when
  the counter is already positive. Written the other way it always finds the
  innermost paren, which makes the rule a silent no-op.
- **Literal length includes the suffix.** `int_literal_len("3u")` returns 2.
  Appending a `u` without checking produces `3uu`.

### 5.5 When conversion fails

It must fail visibly. On a compile error the backend writes three things to
`glesmod/native.log`:

1. The source exactly as received from `glShaderSource`.
2. The source actually handed to the driver.
3. The driver's own error text from `glGetShaderInfoLog`.

That triple is what makes a shader failure diagnosable instead of mysterious,
and it is the mechanism by which every converter bug in this repository was
found. `native/tools/extract_device_fixtures.py` turns such a dump back into a
test fixture.

## 6. Java layer

Four packages, no rendering work.

```
com.youyimc.glesmod
├── GLESMod.java            mod entry (common)
├── GLESModClient.java      client entry: startup report + runtime polling
├── Config.java             NeoForge config spec
├── capability/             GlesCapabilities (immutable snapshot),
│                           GlesCapabilityProvider (stable public interface)
├── backend/                GlesBackendStatus — reads and parses status.json
├── compat/                 CompatDetector, CompatTarget
└── degrade/                DegradeEvent, DegradeReason
```

### 6.1 `GlesCapabilities`

An **immutable snapshot**, published once and readable from any thread. It is
deliberately not live: capability does not change at runtime, so making it
mutable would only invite races.

`GlesCapabilities.INACTIVE` is the conservative default (all flags false,
minimum capacities). Every accessor on the provider interface is required to
return a conservative value and **never throw** when the backend is inactive —
an exception on a render-adjacent path would crash the game, which contradicts
the project's core rule.

`getGlesVersion()` returns a **stable-format** string
(`"OpenGL ES 3.2 (reported as GL 3.2)"`). Mods parse it, so the format is part
of the contract.

### 6.2 `GLESModClient`

Three responsibilities:

1. **Startup report** on `FMLClientSetupEvent` — capability snapshot, degrade
   events, compat results.
2. **Runtime polling** every 100 ticks (~5 s) on `ClientTickEvent.Post`.
3. **Config screen** registration.

The polling is not a convenience. The startup report happens once, but some
failures occur much later — Iris creating framebuffers when the player enables
a shaderpack can be a minute after launch, and the native side only writes its
useful attachment detail when `glCheckFramebufferStatus` sees an incomplete FBO.
Without polling, that evidence is written to `status.json` and never surfaced.
It is also load-bearing because on at least one confirmed launcher
(ZalithLauncher2) our stderr is not collected at all, making `status.json` the
only reliable diagnostic channel.

Novelty is tracked by `reason + detail`, **not by reason code**: one code can
cover many distinct problems, and deduplicating by code would swallow new ones.

Polling failures are swallowed at `debug` level by design — a diagnostic
feature must never affect the game.

---

## 7. The Java ↔ native contract

### 7.1 Why files, not JNI

`libgl_gles.so` is loaded by the launcher, i.e. outside the mod's JVM class
loader. A Java callback would need cross-loader thread attachment. Two files are
a channel both sides can write without that complexity.

### 7.2 `glesmod/status.json`

Path overridable by `GLESMOD_STATUS_FILE`. Java side is
`GlesBackendStatus` in the `backend` package.

The file carries `abi_version`, `active`, `gles_version`, `degrade_level`,
capability booleans, capacity integers, `degrade_events`,
`missing_symbols`, `stub_symbols`, and `last_calls`.

Parsing notes that matter if you edit it:

- The Java parser is **regex-based, not a JSON library**. The format is produced
  by this project and is flat and fixed; adding a dependency to read a small
  file is not justified. If you add nesting, expect to update the patterns.
- `missing_symbols` and `stub_symbols` share the shape
  `{"count":N,"names":[…]}`. The parser locates the **enclosing block first**
  and only then reads `names`. Matching `"names"` globally would silently
  capture only the first block and drop the stub list — which is precisely the
  information that says which features are inert.
- **ABI mismatch is rejected.** A jar and a `.so` are distributed separately and
  can drift, so the version is checked and a mismatch yields an inactive state
  rather than a wrong reading.

### 7.3 ABI versioning rules

`GLESMOD_ABI_VERSION` is currently `1`.

- Adding a capability bit in a **reserved** position → no bump.
- Changing the meaning of a used bit, or any struct/array layout → **bump**.

### 7.4 Capability bits

`GLESMOD_CAP_*` in `gles_backend.h`, mirrored as booleans in
`GlesCapabilities`. Bits 11–31 are reserved and must be zero. The header is the
authority for the bit assignment; the Java parser reads the JSON, not the bits,
so the two must be changed together.

---

## 8. Configuration

Three layers, in decreasing priority:

```
FCL plugin environment variables  >  NeoForge config file  >  auto-probe  >  built-in defaults
```

Environment variables win because they are an explicit per-launch choice made
outside the game.

### 8.1 Environment variables (`gles_backend.h`)

| Variable | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GLESMOD_ENABLE` | 0/1 | Master switch |
| `GLESMOD_DEGRADE_LEVEL` | 0/1/2 | 0 conservative, 1 default, 2 aggressive |
| `GLESMOD_TRACE` | 0/1/2 | 0 off; 1 record only pre-init calls (**default**); 2 record everything |
| `GLESMOD_STATE_CACHE` | 0/1 | Redundant-state-call elimination |
| `GLESMOD_LOG_LEVEL` | 0/1/2 | 1 is the default; 2 emits per-symbol resolution lines |
| `GLESMOD_STATUS_FILE` | path | Override `status.json` location |
| `GLESMOD_LOG_FILE` | path | Override `native.log` location |
| `GLESMOD_SHADER_PROBE` | 0/1 | Dump shader source on compile failure |
| `GLESMOD_GEOM_PROBE` | 0/1 | Geometry diagnostic probe |
| `GLESMOD_ABI` | int | Expected ABI version |
| `POJAVEXEC_EGL` | lib name | Set by the launcher; the EGL instance we must take `eglGetProcAddress` from |

`GLESMOD_TRACE=1` deserves explanation. Full-sequence tracing costs a branch and
an atomic increment on **every** GL call; measured, that is 29 instructions to
reach the real call versus 15 when tracing only the pre-initialisation window.
At roughly 5×10⁴ calls per frame the difference is ~0.2 ms/frame, 6 % of a
300 FPS frame. Both real-device SIGSEGVs we chased were early-initialisation
problems, so the default covers the actual need — and level 2 remains available
for "crashes after a long run" without rebuilding.

### 8.2 NeoForge config (`Config.java`)

`enabled`, `degradeLevel`, `verboseLog`, `warnIfInactive`, `pollStatusFile`.

`degradeLevel` is read by native **from the environment**, so changing it in the
config file requires a restart — stated in the config comments.

---

## 9. Compatibility detection

`CompatDetector` does one thing: read the mod list and adjust strategy.

It **does not** patch, mixin-inject into, or reflectively touch Sodium or
Embeddium. Reasons: their internals change between versions, injection produces
hard-to-diagnose conflicts and breaks on upgrade, and Sodium has been under
Polyform Shield since 0.6, so copying its code is not permitted in any case.

| Detected | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Sodium `0.8.13…` (**prefix** match) | `FULLY_SUPPORTED` |
| Any other Sodium | `CONSERVATIVE` |
| Embeddium, any version | `CONSERVATIVE` |
| Nothing | Vanilla path, logged |

Prefix matching is intentional, so build variants such as `0.8.13+build.7` are
accepted. The bias is explicit: **prefer conservative over optimistic** — an
unknown version takes the conservative path and says so rather than guessing at
internals.

---

## 10. Diagnostics and how to read them

### 10.1 The two files

| File | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `glesmod/status.json` | native | Java, once at startup and every ~5 s |
| `glesmod/native.log` | native | humans |

`native.log` exists because relying on stderr is not safe here: on device we hit
a case where the game log contained **zero** lines from this library, and that
situation is ambiguous between "we were never loaded" and "stderr was not
captured" — opposite conclusions. Writing our own file removes the ambiguity.

### 10.2 Reading a shader failure

Look for `编译失败的着色器 —— 阶段=…，GL 名称=N`, followed by the
raw/converted source pair and the driver's message. Compare the two sources;
the difference is what we changed. This is how every converter defect was found,
and `native/tools/extract_device_fixtures.py` can turn the dump into a
permanent regression fixture.

### 10.3 Interpreting the startup report

```
GlesCapabilities{active=true, gles=3.2, reportedGl=3.2, degradeLevel=1,
 multiDraw=false, computeShader=true, persistentMapping=true,
 instancing=true, indirectDraw=true, maxTextureUnits=96, maxDrawBuffers=4,
 maxTextureSize=16384, maxSamples=4, maxVertexAttribs=32}
```

`multiDraw=false` on ES is expected and is not a fault — it is why Sodium falls
back from multi-draw to per-chunk submission.

---

## 11. Testing and gates

Everything runs on the **host**, in seconds, with no device. That is deliberate:
a converter regression surfaces on device as an opaque driver message, which is
a slow and expensive way to learn about it.

```bash
py -X utf8 native/tools/run_all_gates.py
```

| Gate | What it establishes |
|---|---|
| `roundtrip` | Fixtures convert, and the output compiles under the real GLSL ES front end (`glslc` from the NDK) |
| `veil pinwheel` | Veil's 48 shaders convert and compile |
| `mc core` | All 125 Minecraft core shaders convert and compile |
| `bsl pack` | 182 shaders from a real shaderpack |
| `flywheel dumps` | Flywheel's assembled device shaders re-convert cleanly |
| `sable splice` | Sable's Flywheel overrides spliced into a real device dump, then converted |
| `gitignore` | Third-party material cannot reach git history |
| `device fixtures` | Shaders that **actually failed on a phone** now compile |
| `builtin int args` | Built-ins with `int` parameters are not float-ised |
| `artifact freshness` | The shipped binaries contain the current fixes |

### 11.1 Two methodologies that are not optional

**Attribution.** "It passes now" does not show that *your change* is why. Build
with the matching `-DGLESMOD_NO_RULE_X` and confirm the failure returns. A
change without an attributed before/after is not verified.

**Baseline choice.** When comparing converter output, do **not** diff the
original source against the converted source. They differ in two ways — the
`#version`/precision header *and* our rewrites — so a line we never touched can
appear "broken" purely because desktop GLSL performs implicit conversions that
ES does not. The correct baseline is `raw_es`: the original source with **only
the header swapped and no conversion applied**, representing what a pure
pass-through would hand the driver.

```
raw_es PASS + conv FAIL  ->  regression we introduced
raw_es FAIL + conv PASS  ->  fixed by us
raw_es FAIL + conv FAIL  ->  still unfixed
```

---

## 12. Building

```bash
./gradlew build                 # NeoForge mod jar
```

```powershell
./build-all.ps1 -WithPlugin     # jar + .so (both ABIs) + plugin APK
./build-all.ps1                 # jar + .so only
```

> `-WithPlugin` is **not** implied. Without it the APK is not rebuilt, so the

Toolchain: JDK 21, Android SDK (`aapt2`, `d8`, `zipalign`, `apksigner`),
Android NDK 27.x (Clang, CMake, Ninja, `glslc`). See
[`build-environment.md`](build-environment.md).

Notes that save time:

- Gradle must be run with `--offline` in this environment (the NeoForged maven
  host is not reachable), so builds use the local Gradle cache.
- `org.gradle.configuration-cache=false` is **required**: ModDevGradle 2.0.146
  fails to serialise `CreateMinecraftArtifacts` under Gradle's configuration
  cache. This is a plugin limitation, not a defect here.
- `glslc` must be passed `--target-env=opengl`.

## 13. Extending the project

### 13.1 Adding a forwarded GL function

1. Add the entry to `native/symbols.def` with class `F`.
2. Run `py native/tools/gen_symbols_def.py` / `gen_gl_forwarders.py`.
3. Run `verify_ptr_types.py` — it checks pointer stars against `gl.xml`. A
   missing `*` once turned `glGetIntegerv(GLenum, GLint *)` into
   `glGetIntegerv(GLenum, GLint)`; on AArch64 the pointer was truncated to 32
   bits and the driver faulted inside `GL.createCapabilities()`. Nothing is
   visible at compile or link time. Hence: always run this gate.

### 13.2 Adding a safe stub

Same, class `S`. Then decide whether calling it should record a degradation
event — it usually should, since a stub being called means a feature is inert.

### 13.3 Adding a converter rule

1. Write a **minimal fixture** that fails before the change. Prefer one derived
   from a real device failure (`extract_device_fixtures.py`).
2. Confirm the failure with a control build (`-DGLESMOD_NO_RULE_X`).
3. Implement the rule behind its own switch.
4. Emit a **required-string marker** and register it in
   `native/tools/required_strings.txt`.
5. Prove the A/B difference and re-run every gate.
6. Document the rule in `shader.c` with the device evidence — every existing
   rule carries its evidence inline, and that convention is what makes the file
   maintainable.

### 13.4 Adding a capability bit

Add to `GLESMOD_CAP_*` in a **reserved** position (no ABI bump), mirror it in
`GlesCapabilities` and the JSON parser, and document it. Changing a used bit
requires an ABI bump.

## 14. Known divergences between docs and code

Recorded so nobody is misled by stale text:

- **[`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) is partially out of date.**
  It still describes `native/src/entry_gl11.c`, `entry_gl20.c`,
  `entry_gl30.c`, `caps.c`, `state.c`, `shader_conv.c`, `log.c`, and a
  `check_symbols.sh`. The actual sources are `core.c`, `custom.c`, `enum.c`,
  `generated_forwarders.c`, `probe.c`, `shader.c`, with a Python toolchain under
  `native/tools/`.
- **The same document describes JNI**, plus `config/` and `capability/` Java
  packages. There is no JNI; the boundary is `status.json`. There is no
  `config/` package (`Config.java` is top-level).
- **It describes the FCL plugin as v2** (`fclPlugin_V2`, a JSON
  `RendererConfigV2` in `strings.xml`). The shipped plugin is **v1**
  (`fclPlugin` + `renderer` + `des` + `boatEnv` + `pojavEnv` as manifest
  metadata). The v1 choice is deliberate: `pojavEnv` injects environment
  variables directly, which is how `LIBGL_ES=3` is set.
- **It describes a `capability-interface.md` JNI return-value contract**
  (§4). That section is obsolete for the same reason.

This document and the code are the authority; where they disagree with
`architecture.md`, the code wins.
